          Hi! I’m Talia.
          <br />
            I’m a passionate Web Developer looking to become a member of an
          innovative and productive team. I’m looking to find a place where
          quality, collaboration and creativity co-exist. I have 1 year of Web
          Development experience and 8 years of Environmental Graphic Design
          experience. I create concepts, develop proofs and layouts for
          clients with existing brands. Through my work, I have also attained
          meaningful experience with the following: Visual identity design,
          Marketing and Advertising design, Publication design, Presentation
          Design and Art and Illustration design.
        </a>
        </div>
